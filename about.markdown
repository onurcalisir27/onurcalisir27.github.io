# Write about Curiosity and Living in both Coasts of the Cout
 Outside of school and work, I enjoy exploring nature, hiking, and biking. I'm also a big history nerd, and I love reading about stories from our past.

## What do I do?

 I am working to become a Robotics Software Engineer. I am passionate about Autonomous Systems, Learning Controllers, and all things robotics! I am experienced in programming in C++, Python, ROS, and MATLAB; educated in machine learning algorithms, optimization methods, and learning based models.

 Alonside my software skills, I am also trained in CAD software(OnShape, SolidWorks, AutoCAD), 3D Printing and Rapid Prototyping, and Electronics/Mechatronics.

  For my research project I have combined my software and hardware skills to build an autonomous rover, starting from the CADing and wiring of the components to writing ROS code to control my robot to autonomously navigate! Read more about my projects: [**here**](/project/)

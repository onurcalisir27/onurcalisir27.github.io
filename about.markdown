      <p>Hello there! I'm Onur (pronounced "Honor"), a mechanical engineer working in the intersection of robotics, control systems and software development. Originally from Turkey, I'm currently pursuing my Masters at Columbia University, where I've discovered my passion about creating autonomous robotic systems that can navigate and interact with our complex world.</p>
      <p>What excites me most is the interdisciplinary nature of modern robotics. Every project requires me to think like a mechanical engineer, a software engineer, and a systems engineer. This complexity is what makes each day in robotics feel like solving a new problem, with new skills to learn.</p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>My current research is on <strong>Learning-Based Nonlinear Adaptive Control</strong> for mobile robots in repetitive environments to learn and traverse complex environments. I'm working on an autonomous rover project that combines:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Mechanical Design:</strong> Custom designed chassis and parts for motor and sensor integration</li>
    <li><strong>Perception:</strong> RGBD Computer vision and sensor fusion for environment processing</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Control:</strong> Implementing adaptive controllers that learn and improve over time</li>
    <li><strong>Software Stack:</strong> ROS2 software stack for communication between subsystems of the robot</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
   <p>I believe we're at the dawn of the Physical AI revolution, where intelligent systems aren't only processing information, but actively engaging with and improving our world. My goal is to contribute to this transformation by developing robust, self-learning robots that can operate safely alongside humans.</p>
   <p>As I progress through my master's program, I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge robotics research and development. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can work on autonomous systems, learning-based control, and the practical deployment of AI in physical systems.</p>
